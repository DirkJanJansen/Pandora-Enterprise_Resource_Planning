The given code is a Python program that imports various modules and defines several functions and classes. The code imports the following modules: - `login` module, which contains the `hoofdMenu` function - `datetime` module, which provides classes for manipulating dates and times - `PyQt5.QtPrintSupport` module, which provides classes for printing support in PyQt5 - `PyQt5.QtChart` module, which provides classes for creating charts in PyQt5 - `PyQt5.QtCore` module, which provides core non-GUI functionality in PyQt5 - `PyQt5.QtGui` module, which provides classes for graphical user interface functionality in PyQt5 - `PyQt5.QtWidgets` module, which provides classes for creating GUI applications in PyQt5 - `sqlalchemy` module, which provides SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tools for Python The code defines the following functions: - `jaarweek()`: This function returns the current year and week number in the format "yyyyww". - `windowSluit(self, m_email)`: This function closes the current window and opens the main menu window. - `sluit(self, m_email)`: This function closes the current window and calls the `zoekwk` function. - `ongInvoer()`: This function displays a warning message box with the text "Please re-enter incorrect input search term!". - `zoekwk(m_email)`: This function defines a class `Widget` that creates a dialog window for searching and selecting charts. It displays a combo box for selecting a chart type and a line edit for entering a year week report. It also includes buttons for searching, closing, and applying the selected chart. The function calls the `printGrafiek` function with the selected chart type, year week report, and email as arguments. - `printGrafiek(keuze, jrwk, m_email)`: This function defines a class `Widget` that creates a dialog window for displaying financial graphs. It retrieves data from a database based on the selected chart type and year week report. It then creates a chart using the retrieved data and displays it in the window. The function includes buttons for printing, previewing, and closing the window. The function also calls the `sluit` function when the close button is clicked.
