The given code is a Python program that uses the PyQt5 library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for an authorisation program. The program allows users to search for an account number and customize the authorisations for that account. The code imports various modules and classes from different libraries, such as `Counter` from the `collections` module, `hoofdMenu` from the `login` module, and various classes from the `PyQt5.QtWidgets`, `PyQt5.QtGui`, and `PyQt5.QtCore` modules. The code defines several functions, including `foutAccountnr`, `windowSluit`, `winSluit`, `updateOK`, `info`, `zoekAccount`, and `geefAuth`. These functions are used to display error messages, close windows, update authorisations, display information, search for an account, and customize authorisations, respectively. The code also defines two classes, `Widget` and `Widget`, which are subclasses of the `QDialog` class from the `PyQt5.QtWidgets` module. These classes are used to create custom dialog windows for displaying information and customizing authorisations. The `zoekAccount` function allows users to search for an account number by entering it in a QLineEdit widget. If the account number is found in the database, the `geefAuth` function is called to customize the authorisations for that account. If the account number is not found, an error message is displayed and the `zoekAccount` function is called again. The `geefAuth` function creates a custom dialog window using the `Widget` class. This window displays checkboxes for each authorisation category and allows the user to customize the authorisations by checking or unchecking the checkboxes. When the user clicks the "Update" button, the authorisations are updated in the database and a success message is displayed.
