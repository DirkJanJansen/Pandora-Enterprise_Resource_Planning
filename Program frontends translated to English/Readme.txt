On many requests I decided to translate the frontends of
the programfiles from Dutch to English
First translations of program files realised:

Pandora.py
login.py
invoerAccount.py
wijzAccount.py
opvrAccounts.py
bestelOrder.py
webRetouren.py
opvrKlantenorders.py
 
This means that frontends from  Mainmenu and 
submenus from Accounts are translated to English.

In the coming period other submenu's will follow.

To implement overwrite the existing programs with
the translated ones.
