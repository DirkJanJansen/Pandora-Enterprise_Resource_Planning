The database bisystem is imported in postgresql.
pgdrop-bisystem.bat is included for deleting the database bisystem (change pathnames to your own pathnames)

If you change install folders, the pathnames in pgrestore-custom.bat, pgrestore-custom-empty.bat

Open pgadmin 4, open servers, open postgresql (16 or 17), open databases, select bisystem with your right mouse button and choose
Delete (force), choose databases with your right mouse button and choose create database, type bisystem and create database,
select bisystem with your right mouse button and choose restore, browse to your path were bisystem.backup is located and restore.
Wait untill the proces is finished and your new database is installed.
