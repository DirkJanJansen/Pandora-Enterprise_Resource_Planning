Barcode module in python


The database has been extended with a new table balieverkoop (countersales).
This table is used for barcode scanning see following lines and barcodeScan.py
This module scans and displays the data from database, prints the orderform and books the financial data and stock data
in the tables artikelen (updates stock), afdrachten (payments) and artikelmutaties (stock transactions).

real time scanning in windows 10:
I used a laser scanner for testing see documentation in folder Tools/Barcodescanner
The windows device for this scanner is SHANG CHEN HID SC-32, it's a USB Handheld scanner (approx € 50,--)
It's automatically installed by Windows 10 and is working well.
 
The barcode problem with stopping by the thirst scan in Ubuntu is solved now:
Open terminal Ctrl+Alt+t and  apply command:
sudo modprobe usbkbd
This works for me!
The issue is permantly solved see LINUX install.txt

I developed a PyQt5 module for real time scanning:
The module scans barcodes from a printing barcodes.png
Print this out on high resolution in grayscale.
The scanned products are queried automatically with the database bisystem
A filelist for printing is added with artikelID descriptions amounts prices subtotals and VAT
barcodeScan.py started from submenu Magazijn line 9
2020-03-21:
The module barcodeScan.py is rewritten due to performance issues. The database is extended with a 
table balieverkoop for barcodescanning, so the data is moved from disk to database bisystem. 
The performance issues are solved!
With the latest update it's possible to book return goods for authorised personel.
 The button is only accessible if a person with special rights (S) on Magazijn Menu (5[1]) logs in.
 
 With the module invoerArtikelen.py (insert new products) a barcodenumber is generated based on the artikelID 
 in the table artikelen.
 Also a barcodeimage is saved in folder ./forms/Barcodelabels for printing.
